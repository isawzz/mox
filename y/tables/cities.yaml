      New York (known as "The Big Apple", "NYC," and often called "New York
      City") is a global center for media, entertainment, art, fashion,
      research, finance, and trade. The bustling, cosmopolitan heart of the 4th
      largest metropolis in the world and by far the most populous city in the
      United States, New York has long been a key entry point and a defining
      city for the nation.

      From the Statue of Liberty in the harbor to the Empire State Building
      towering over the Manhattan skyline, from the tunnels of the subway to the
      riches of Wall Street, from the bright signs of Times Square to the
      naturalistic beauty of Central Park, and from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx
      to Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York's landmarks are quintessential
      American landmarks. The city's neighborhoods and streets are so iconic
      they have become ingrained into the American consciousness. Here the
      power, wealth and culture of the United States is on full display in one
      of the largest and most iconic skylines in the world, in the food and
      music to be found around every corner, and in the diverse population of
      immigrants who come from every corner of the globe to take part in what
      this city has to offer.

      Lying at the mouth of the Hudson River in the southernmost part of the
      state of the same name and at the center of the Mid-Atlantic region, New
      York City is home to approximately 8.3 million people. The New York
      Metropolitan Area, which spans lower New York state, northern New Jersey,
      and southwestern Connecticut, has a population of 18.9 million, making it
      the largest metropolitan area in the U.S.

      Europe's wealthiest nations. "Arm aber sexy" (poor but sexy) as a former
      mayor would have it, Berlin attracts young people, students and a creative
      bohème like few other cities in the world. With architectural heritage
      from Prussian monarchism, Nazism, East German communism and Potsdamer
      Platz, filled with 1990s and 2000s-style glass palaces after having been a
      "blank canvas" due to the wall, Berlin's architecture is as varied as its
      neighbourhoods and its people. And due to its long history as a
      cosmopolitan capital, it has attracted immigrants from all over the world
      for more than 300 years now, who continue to leave their own marks on the
      city.

      Berlin is home to world-renowned universities, orchestras, museums, and
      entertainment venues, and is host to many sporting events. Its Zoological
      Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular
      worldwide. The city is well known for its festivals, nightlife,

      in Australia with an enviable reputation as one of the world's most
      beautiful and livable cities. Brimming with history, nature, culture, art,

      planet. The gateway to Australia, it lies on the deepest natural harbour
      in the world and stretches for 140 kilometres.

      Since its founding in 1147, Moscow (Russian: Москва, Moskva) has been at
      the crossroads of history as the capital of empires and a frequent target
      for invaders. As the capital of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and,
      today, the Russian Federation, it has played a central role in the
      development of the largest country in the world. For many, the sight of
      the Kremlin complex in the centre of the city is still loaded with
      symbolism and history.

      Today, Moscow is a thriving, exuberant capital city that overflows with
      life, culture and sometimes traffic. A sprawling metropolis, the
      northernmost and coldest megacity on the planet, and the most populous
      city entirely within Europe, Moscow is home to numerous museums,
      Soviet-era monoliths and post-Soviet kitsch, but continues to pave the way
      forward as Muscovites move into the 21st century.

      Beijing (北京 Běijīng) is China's capital, and its second largest city after
      Shanghai, with a population of more than 20 million. It had been the
      capital of Imperial China for much of its history, and became seat of the
      People's Republic of China after the Chinese revolutions, as well as the
      country's educational and cultural center.

      The city is well known for its flatness and regular construction. There
      are only three hills to be found within the city limits (in Jingshan Park
      to the north of the famous Forbidden City). Like the configuration of the
      Forbidden City, Beijing is surrounded by concentric so-called "ring
      roads", which are actually rectangular.

      Beijing is a dynamic, changing city. There is a mix of old and new all
      around (especially within the 3rd and 2nd Ring Roads). Here you can see
      the most modern, envelope-pushing technologies and social innovations
      butting heads with the most ancient cultural norms and social settings.
      The people here can seem a bit cold, but once you break the ice you will
      find that they are very friendly and engaging, and speaking some Mandarin
      is definitely helpful.

      Be prepared for customs and societal norms that are different from yours;
      see the China article for discussion. However most Beijingers are
      sophisticated urbanites, so things may seem less odd here than in rural
      areas or cities in the interior of China.

      The city hosted the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the 2022 Winter
      Olympics, making it the only city in the world that has hosted both summer
      and winter Olympic Games.

      Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil, on the South Atlantic
      coast. Rio is famous for its breathtaking landscape, its laid-back beach
      culture and its annual carnival. The "Carioca Landscapes between the
      Mountain and the Sea" has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage
      list.

      The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is comprised of a unique entry from the
      ocean that makes it appear as the mouth of a river. Additionally, the
      harbor is surrounded by spectacular geographic features including
      Sugarloaf mountain at 395 meters (1,296 feet), Corcovado Peak at 704
      meters (2,310 feet), and the hills of Tijuca at 1,021 meters (3,350 feet).
      These features work together to collectively make the harbor one of the
      Seven Natural Wonders of the World.

      Rio de Janeiro hosted many of the 2014 FIFA World Cup games, including the
      final. It also hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, becoming
      the first South American city to host the Summer Olympics.
